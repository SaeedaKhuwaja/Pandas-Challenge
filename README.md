# PyCitySchool Analysis

The calculation was made by School Data and Student Data of different schools by Pandas Library and Jupyter Notebook.

Over the course of different charts, we analyzed how different schools performed based on certain controllables and metrics. We looked at Schoolâ€™s Budget, Per Child Spending, School Size and School Type to compare how different schools performed on Average Math, Average Reading and Overall Percentage.

First, we saw that different schools have different budgets and passing percentages. It seems that there is no relation of budget with the passing percentages of students. The passing percentages seems to perform better according to their types. The Charter Schools have higher passing percentages as compared with the District Schools. Also, the number of students make a big difference in the passing percentages. The schools which have more number of students tends to have less passing percentages as compared to less number of students.

Based on the analysis, here are the conclusions we can draw:
1. Per student Budget has no correlation with the overall passing percentage.
2. Charter Schools perform better than District Schools
3. Small and medium schools have better overall passing percentage as compared to large schools.
